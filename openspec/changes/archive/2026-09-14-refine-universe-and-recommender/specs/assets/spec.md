## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Add an asset by ticker

The system SHALL allow a client to add an asset by its ticker symbol. The system SHALL normalize the ticker (trim and uppercase), fetch market and profile data from the market-data provider, derive metrics, and evaluate eligibility before any persistence occurs. The system SHALL support only tradeable categories — **stock** and **crypto**; an asset the provider classifies as any other category (for example ETF, fund, or other) SHALL be rejected and SHALL NOT be persisted. The stored asset SHALL include ticker, name, category, sector, exchange, currency, profile fields, derived metrics, an eligibility flag, and the per-criterion evaluation results.

#### Scenario: Successfully add a new asset

- **WHEN** a client POSTs a valid, previously unseen ticker classified as stock or crypto
- **THEN** the system fetches its data, evaluates eligibility, persists the asset, and responds 201 with the full asset record including its criteria results

#### Scenario: Unsupported category

- **WHEN** a client adds a ticker the provider classifies as a category other than stock or crypto (for example an ETF, mutual fund, or other instrument)
- **THEN** the system SHALL respond 422 naming the unsupported category and SHALL NOT persist the asset

#### Scenario: Duplicate ticker

- **WHEN** a client adds a ticker that already exists (after normalization)
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT create a second record and SHALL respond 409

#### Scenario: Unknown ticker

- **WHEN** a client adds a ticker the provider cannot resolve to usable data
- **THEN** the system SHALL respond 422 and SHALL NOT persist a partial record

#### Scenario: Market data temporarily unavailable

- **WHEN** the market-data provider fails or times out while adding an asset
- **THEN** the system SHALL respond 503 and SHALL NOT persist a partial record
