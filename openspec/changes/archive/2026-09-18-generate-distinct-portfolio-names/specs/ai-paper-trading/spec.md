## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Build an AI portfolio and execute it as paper trades

The system SHALL accept a request to build an AI portfolio over the current asset universe and an amount of capital to allocate, with options for risk profile, whether the portfolio is enrolled in daily rebalancing, and an **asset scope** selecting which asset types the portfolio may hold: stocks only, crypto only, or both. The asset scope SHALL default to both (the whole supported universe) when not specified, and the allocated capital SHALL default to a configured default amount. The request SHALL NOT accept a candidate ticker list or per-position allocation caps. The AI SHALL be given as candidates every asset in the universe **whose category is within the selected asset scope** (enriched with name, sector, category, and eligibility), MAY research and propose assets not currently in the universe (discovery is always enabled), and SHALL produce long-only target holdings whose allocations are fractions in [0, 1] that sum to approximately 1.0 (an allocation of ~0 excludes a holding). Newly discovered tickers SHALL be added to the universe on a best-effort basis, bounded by a configured maximum number of new assets per run, **and a discovered asset whose category falls outside the selected asset scope SHALL be rejected — not added and not traded**; if an in-scope add fails the ticker SHALL still be eligible for the portfolio. The selected asset scope SHALL be persisted with the session so that later automated rebalances honour the same scope. The request SHALL be processed in the background and SHALL return immediately with an event identifier for polling. Execution SHALL: ask the AI for target holdings and allocations, create a portfolio **with a generated distinct name** and a paper-trading session, size each position from the allocated capital and a current quote, submit the corresponding buy orders through the brokerage, and record each executed trade and a run summary. The generated portfolio name SHALL be human-friendly and SHALL be distinct from the names of existing portfolios, so that portfolios and their sessions can be told apart; the name MAY reflect the selected risk profile. The AI's research SHALL be cost-bounded per run by a configured maximum number of reasoning turns and a hard cap on the number of web searches.

#### Scenario: Queue a build

- **WHEN** a client requests an AI portfolio build while the asset universe is non-empty
- **THEN** the system SHALL create a build event, start background processing, and respond with the event id and a running status

#### Scenario: Empty universe rejected

- **WHEN** a client requests an AI portfolio build while the asset universe is empty
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request rather than starting a build

#### Scenario: Build executes

- **WHEN** the background build runs
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the portfolio and session, place the sized buy orders via the brokerage, record the executed trades and a run entry, and mark the build event succeeded (or partial if some orders could not be placed)

#### Scenario: Build assigns a distinct portfolio name

- **WHEN** the background build creates the portfolio
- **THEN** the system SHALL assign a generated, human-friendly name that differs from the names of existing portfolios

#### Scenario: Default capital and scope

- **WHEN** a client requests a build without specifying allocated capital or asset scope
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the configured default capital amount and an asset scope of both (stocks and crypto)

#### Scenario: Scope restricts the candidate universe

- **WHEN** a build requests an asset scope of stocks only (or crypto only)
- **THEN** the AI SHALL be given only universe assets whose category matches the scope, and the resulting portfolio SHALL contain only assets of the selected type

#### Scenario: AI discovers a new asset

- **WHEN** the AI proposes a holding whose ticker is not in the current universe and whose category is within the selected asset scope
- **THEN** the system SHALL attempt to add that asset to the universe (up to the configured per-run limit) and SHALL still include the ticker in the portfolio and its trades even if the add fails

#### Scenario: AI discovers an out-of-scope asset

- **WHEN** the AI proposes a holding whose category falls outside the selected asset scope
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject that asset — neither adding it to the universe nor trading it — while continuing the rest of the build

#### Scenario: Position too small to trade

- **WHEN** an allocation buys less than one whole share at the current quote
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip that position without failing the whole build and SHALL record it as not executed

### Requirement: Read paper-trading session data

The system SHALL let a client list paper-trading sessions and read a session's trades, runs, positions, its AI-portfolio events, and its daily portfolio-value snapshots. A session returned to a client SHALL include the name of the portfolio it trades so the client can identify the session by portfolio; when the portfolio cannot be resolved the name SHALL be absent (null) rather than causing an error. An AI-portfolio event returned to a client SHALL include the AI's reasoning output and its persisted research transcript. A trade or closed position returned to a client SHALL include the reference to the AI-portfolio event that produced it, when present. A session's value history SHALL be returned ordered oldest snapshot first.

#### Scenario: Inspect a session

- **WHEN** a client requests a session's trades, runs, positions, or events
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the recorded data for that session

#### Scenario: Session identifies its portfolio

- **WHEN** a client lists sessions or reads a single session
- **THEN** each returned session SHALL include the name of the portfolio it trades

#### Scenario: Event includes reasoning and research

- **WHEN** a client reads an AI-portfolio event
- **THEN** the returned event SHALL include the AI reasoning output and the persisted research transcript

#### Scenario: Read session value history

- **WHEN** a client requests a session's value history
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the session's daily value snapshots ordered oldest first, each with its date, total value, cash value, positions value, and day's profit and loss
