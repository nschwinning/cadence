## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Build an AI portfolio and execute it as paper trades

The system SHALL accept a request to build an AI portfolio over the current asset universe and an amount of capital to allocate, with options for risk profile, whether the portfolio is enrolled in daily rebalancing, an **asset scope** selecting which asset types the portfolio may hold: stocks only, crypto only, or both, whether the portfolio **uses the technical-indicator trend strategy** (an opt-in that defaults to off when not specified), whether the portfolio **enables an automatic hard stop-loss** (an opt-in that defaults to off when not specified) together with a **stop-loss threshold percentage** (defaulting to a configured default when the stop-loss is enabled without an explicit threshold), whether the portfolio **enables portfolio risk guardrails** (an opt-in that defaults to off when not specified) together with the guardrail parameters — a **maximum percentage per asset**, a **maximum percentage per asset class**, a **minimum number of positions**, and a **maximum invested percentage** (cash buffer) — each defaulting to a configured default when the guardrails are enabled without an explicit value, and an optional **benchmark index** (from the fixed benchmark catalog) the session's performance is compared against. The asset scope SHALL default to both (the whole supported universe) when not specified, the allocated capital SHALL default to a configured default amount, and the benchmark SHALL default to a configured default benchmark (S&P 500) when not specified. A benchmark selection outside the catalog SHALL be rejected. The request SHALL NOT accept a candidate ticker list. The request MAY carry the guardrail parameters described above; it SHALL NOT accept any other per-position allocation cap. The AI SHALL be given as candidates every asset in the universe **whose category is within the selected asset scope** (enriched with name, sector, category, and eligibility). **When the session opts into the technical-indicator trend strategy**, the candidate set SHALL additionally be restricted to assets whose latest stored technical-indicator snapshot passes the deterministic uptrend trend gate — a candidate whose gate does not pass, or that has no stored snapshot, SHALL be dropped and SHALL NOT be presented to the AI, so that a portfolio is only ever initialised with assets in a confirmed uptrend — and the surviving candidates SHALL be annotated with their trend indicators. **When the session does not opt in, no trend gate SHALL be applied and every in-scope candidate SHALL be presented to the AI without indicator annotations.** The AI MAY research and propose assets not currently in the universe (discovery is always enabled), and SHALL produce long-only target holdings whose allocations are fractions in [0, 1] that sum to approximately 1.0 (an allocation of ~0 excludes a holding). Newly discovered tickers SHALL be added to the universe on a best-effort basis, bounded by a configured maximum number of new assets per run, **and a discovered asset whose category falls outside the selected asset scope SHALL be rejected — not added and not traded**, and — **only when the session opted into the trend strategy** — a discovered asset that does not pass the trend gate SHALL likewise be excluded from the candidate set; if an in-scope add fails the ticker SHALL still be eligible for the portfolio. **When the session opted into the risk guardrails, the AI SHALL additionally be told the guardrail caps (maximum per asset, maximum per asset class, minimum number of positions, and maximum invested percentage) so it can plan within them.** The selected asset scope SHALL be persisted with the session so that later automated rebalances honour the same scope. The selected technical-indicator opt-in SHALL be persisted (frozen) with the session so that later automated rebalances apply the same choice; a session with no persisted opt-in (for example one built before this option existed) SHALL be treated as opted out. The selected stop-loss opt-in and, when enabled, its threshold percentage SHALL be persisted (frozen) with the session so the automatic stop-loss applies for the session's lifetime; a session with no persisted stop-loss setting (for example one built before this option existed) SHALL be treated as having the stop-loss disabled. The selected risk-guardrail opt-in and, when enabled, its parameters (maximum per asset, maximum per asset class, minimum number of positions, maximum invested percentage) SHALL be persisted (frozen) with the session so the same guardrails apply for the session's lifetime; a session with no persisted guardrail setting (for example one built before this option existed) SHALL be treated as having the guardrails disabled. The selected benchmark SHALL be persisted with the session so the session can be compared against that benchmark over its lifetime. The request SHALL be processed in the background and SHALL return immediately with an event identifier for polling. Execution SHALL: ask the AI for target holdings and allocations, create a portfolio **with a generated distinct name** and a paper-trading session, **when the guardrails are enabled deterministically enforce them on the target-weight vector before sizing** so that no single holding exceeds the maximum-per-asset cap, no asset class exceeds the maximum-per-class cap, and the total invested fraction does not exceed the maximum invested percentage (the remainder held as cash) — excess weight removed by a per-asset or per-class cap SHALL be redistributed proportionally to the holdings still below their caps, and when the caps cannot absorb the full capital the shortfall SHALL remain as cash — size each position from the allocated capital and a current quote, submit the corresponding buy orders through the brokerage, and record each executed trade and a run summary. The deterministic guardrail enforcement is the guarantee; the caps given to the AI are advisory only. The minimum-number-of-positions guardrail SHALL NOT be enforced by fabricating holdings the AI did not pick: it is applied as the AI instruction above plus the diversification floor implied by the maximum-per-asset cap, and when the AI returns fewer holdings than the configured minimum the shortfall SHALL be recorded as a guardrail observation on the run rather than causing the build to fail. The generated portfolio name SHALL be human-friendly and SHALL be distinct from the names of existing portfolios, so that portfolios and their sessions can be told apart; the name MAY reflect the selected risk profile. The AI's research SHALL be cost-bounded per run by a configured maximum number of reasoning turns and a hard cap on the number of web searches.

#### Scenario: Queue a build

- **WHEN** a client requests an AI portfolio build while the asset universe is non-empty
- **THEN** the system SHALL create a build event, start background processing, and respond with the event id and a running status

#### Scenario: Empty universe rejected

- **WHEN** a client requests an AI portfolio build while the asset universe is empty
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request rather than starting a build

#### Scenario: Build executes

- **WHEN** the background build runs
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the portfolio and session, place the sized buy orders via the brokerage, record the executed trades and a run entry, and mark the build event succeeded (or partial if some orders could not be placed)

#### Scenario: Build assigns a distinct portfolio name

- **WHEN** the background build creates the portfolio
- **THEN** the system SHALL assign a generated, human-friendly name that differs from the names of existing portfolios

#### Scenario: Default capital and scope

- **WHEN** a client requests a build without specifying allocated capital or asset scope
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the configured default capital amount and an asset scope of both (stocks and crypto)

#### Scenario: Default benchmark

- **WHEN** a client requests a build without specifying a benchmark
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the configured default benchmark (S&P 500) as the session's benchmark

#### Scenario: Build persists a chosen benchmark

- **WHEN** a client requests a build selecting a benchmark from the catalog
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist that benchmark with the created session

#### Scenario: Stop-loss disabled by default

- **WHEN** a client requests a build without enabling the stop-loss
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the session with the automatic stop-loss disabled

#### Scenario: Build persists the stop-loss setting

- **WHEN** a client requests a build enabling the stop-loss, optionally with a threshold percentage
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the stop-loss as enabled on the created session, using the given threshold or the configured default when none is given

#### Scenario: Guardrails disabled by default

- **WHEN** a client requests a build without enabling the risk guardrails
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the session with the risk guardrails disabled and SHALL apply no allocation caps during the build

#### Scenario: Build persists the guardrail settings

- **WHEN** a client requests a build enabling the risk guardrails, optionally with parameters
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the guardrails as enabled on the created session, using the given maximum-per-asset, maximum-per-class, minimum-positions, and maximum-invested values or the configured defaults when any is not given

#### Scenario: Build clamps an over-cap holding

- **WHEN** a build with guardrails enabled receives AI target allocations in which a single holding exceeds the maximum-per-asset cap
- **THEN** the system SHALL reduce that holding to the cap and redistribute the excess weight to the remaining holdings still below their caps before sizing the positions

#### Scenario: Build caps an over-concentrated asset class

- **WHEN** a build with guardrails enabled receives AI target allocations whose combined weight in one asset class exceeds the maximum-per-class cap
- **THEN** the system SHALL reduce that class's combined weight to the cap and redistribute the excess to holdings in other classes still below their caps before sizing

#### Scenario: Build holds back a cash buffer

- **WHEN** a build with guardrails enabled has a maximum invested percentage below 100%
- **THEN** the system SHALL scale the target weights so the total invested does not exceed the maximum invested percentage and SHALL leave the remainder as cash

#### Scenario: Build records a minimum-positions shortfall without fabricating holdings

- **WHEN** a build with guardrails enabled receives AI target allocations containing fewer holdings than the configured minimum number of positions
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT invent additional holdings and SHALL record the shortfall as a guardrail observation on the run while completing the build with the AI's holdings (after clamping)

#### Scenario: Scope restricts the candidate universe

- **WHEN** a build requests an asset scope of stocks only (or crypto only)
- **THEN** the AI SHALL be given only universe assets whose category matches the scope, and the resulting portfolio SHALL contain only assets of the selected type

#### Scenario: Build opts out of the trend strategy by default

- **WHEN** a client requests a build without specifying the technical-indicator opt-in
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the session as opted out, SHALL NOT apply the trend gate, and SHALL present every in-scope candidate to the AI without indicator annotations

#### Scenario: Trend gate restricts the candidate universe

- **WHEN** a build that opted into the technical-indicator trend strategy assembles the candidate universe
- **THEN** the system SHALL present to the AI only in-scope candidates whose latest indicator snapshot passes the uptrend gate (dropping those that fail or have no snapshot), so the initial portfolio only enters trend-confirmed assets

#### Scenario: AI discovers a new asset

- **WHEN** the AI proposes a holding whose ticker is not in the current universe and whose category is within the selected asset scope
- **THEN** the system SHALL attempt to add that asset to the universe (up to the configured per-run limit) and SHALL still include the ticker in the portfolio and its trades even if the add fails

#### Scenario: AI discovers an out-of-scope asset

- **WHEN** the AI proposes a holding whose category falls outside the selected asset scope
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject that asset — neither adding it to the universe nor trading it — while continuing the rest of the build

#### Scenario: Position too small to trade

- **WHEN** an allocation buys less than one whole share at the current quote
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip that position without failing the whole build and SHALL record it as not executed

### Requirement: Read paper-trading session data

The system SHALL let a client list paper-trading sessions and read a session's trades, runs, positions, its AI-portfolio events, and its daily portfolio-value snapshots. A session returned to a client SHALL include the name of the portfolio it trades so the client can identify the session by portfolio; when the portfolio cannot be resolved the name SHALL be absent (null) rather than causing an error. A session returned to a client SHALL include the benchmark it is compared against. A session returned to a client SHALL include its stop-loss configuration: whether the automatic stop-loss is enabled and, when enabled, its threshold percentage. A session returned to a client SHALL include its risk-guardrail configuration: whether the risk guardrails are enabled and, when enabled, the maximum percentage per asset, the maximum percentage per asset class, the minimum number of positions, and the maximum invested percentage. An AI-portfolio event returned to a client SHALL include the AI's reasoning output and its persisted research transcript. A trade or closed position returned to a client SHALL include the reference to the AI-portfolio event that produced it, when present. A session's value history SHALL be returned ordered oldest snapshot first, and each snapshot in the returned history SHALL carry the value of a buy-and-hold of the session's allocated capital in the session's benchmark as of that snapshot's date, derived from the stored benchmark price series and rebased so the benchmark equals the allocated capital on the session's first snapshot date. When the benchmark has no stored price on or before a snapshot's date, that snapshot's benchmark value SHALL be absent (null) rather than causing an error.

#### Scenario: Inspect a session

- **WHEN** a client requests a session's trades, runs, positions, or events
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the recorded data for that session

#### Scenario: Session identifies its portfolio

- **WHEN** a client lists sessions or reads a single session
- **THEN** each returned session SHALL include the name of the portfolio it trades

#### Scenario: Session reports its benchmark

- **WHEN** a client lists sessions or reads a single session
- **THEN** each returned session SHALL include the benchmark it is compared against

#### Scenario: Session reports its stop-loss configuration

- **WHEN** a client lists sessions or reads a single session
- **THEN** each returned session SHALL include whether its automatic stop-loss is enabled and, when enabled, its threshold percentage

#### Scenario: Session reports its guardrail configuration

- **WHEN** a client lists sessions or reads a single session
- **THEN** each returned session SHALL include whether its risk guardrails are enabled and, when enabled, the maximum percentage per asset, the maximum percentage per asset class, the minimum number of positions, and the maximum invested percentage

#### Scenario: Event includes reasoning and research

- **WHEN** a client reads an AI-portfolio event
- **THEN** the returned event SHALL include the AI reasoning output and the persisted research transcript

#### Scenario: Read session value history

- **WHEN** a client requests a session's value history
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the session's daily value snapshots ordered oldest first, each with its date, total value, cash value, positions value, day's profit and loss, and the rebased benchmark value as of that date

#### Scenario: Benchmark price missing for a date

- **WHEN** a client requests a session's value history and the benchmark has no stored price on or before a snapshot's date
- **THEN** the system SHALL return that snapshot with the benchmark value absent rather than failing the request
