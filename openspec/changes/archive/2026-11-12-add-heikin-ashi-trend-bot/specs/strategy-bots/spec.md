## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Heikin-Ashi Trend strategy

The system SHALL provide a **Heikin-Ashi Trend** strategy, registered alongside the existing
strategies. It SHALL be a pure, long-only signal generator that, given recent bars, the current
position, and its parameters, returns one of ENTER_LONG, EXIT, or HOLD together with a
human-readable reason, performing no I/O and holding no persisted state. Its parameters SHALL be
`volume_filter` (default off) and `volume_window` (at least 2, default 20).

The strategy SHALL build Heikin-Ashi candles over the bars provided, oldest first: each candle's
close is (open + high + low + close) / 4 of its bar; the first candle's open is (open + close) / 2
of its bar and every later candle's open is the mean of the previous Heikin-Ashi candle's open and
close. The latest candle is **green** when its close is strictly above its open and **red**
otherwise. The result SHALL be deterministic for the same bars.

With the volume filter off: while flat, the strategy SHALL signal ENTER_LONG on a green latest
candle; while holding, it SHALL signal EXIT on a red latest candle and HOLD otherwise.

With the volume filter on, volume is **strong** when the latest bar's volume is strictly above the
mean volume of the latest `volume_window` bars (the latest bar included); a window whose mean
volume is zero is never strong. While flat, the strategy SHALL signal ENTER_LONG only on a green
latest candle with strong volume; while holding, it SHALL signal EXIT on a red latest candle or
when volume is not strong, and HOLD otherwise.

With fewer bars than it needs it SHALL signal HOLD. It SHALL never signal a short entry.

#### Scenario: Green candle enters

- **WHEN** the strategy is flat, the volume filter is off and the latest Heikin-Ashi candle is green
- **THEN** it SHALL signal ENTER_LONG

#### Scenario: Red candle exits

- **WHEN** the strategy holds a position and the latest Heikin-Ashi candle is red
- **THEN** it SHALL signal EXIT

#### Scenario: Green candle without strong volume is not entered

- **WHEN** the strategy is flat, the volume filter is on, the latest candle is green and the latest
  volume is at or below the window's mean
- **THEN** it SHALL signal HOLD

#### Scenario: Fading volume exits

- **WHEN** the strategy holds a position with the volume filter on, the latest candle is green and
  the latest volume is at or below the window's mean
- **THEN** it SHALL signal EXIT

#### Scenario: Insufficient history

- **WHEN** fewer bars than the strategy needs are available
- **THEN** it SHALL signal HOLD

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Bot preset catalog

The system SHALL maintain a fixed catalog of **bot presets**. Each preset SHALL have a
stable key, a display name, a short description, a reference to the course algorithm it
reproduces, the key of the registered strategy it uses, that strategy's parameters, and
the risk controls it applies — the take-profit and stop-loss thresholds (each either a
percentage or off) and the drawdown kill-switch limit. A preset SHALL NOT fix the
session's capital, traded assets, benchmark, label, or position-sizing settings; those
remain choices made when a session is created. Every preset's strategy parameters SHALL be
valid for its strategy. Each registered strategy SHALL have exactly one **default
preset**. The system SHALL let a client list the presets, and the listing SHALL report,
for each preset, all of the fields above and whether it is its strategy's default.

The catalog SHALL include these presets, reproducing the reference-course recipes:

- **MA Crossover (Algo 6)** — default for the moving-average crossover strategy: fast
  period 5, slow period 12; take-profit 1%, stop-loss 2%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **RSI Mean Reversion (Algo 16)** — default for the RSI mean-reversion strategy:
  period 14, oversold 30, exit level 50; take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 1%, drawdown
  limit 5%.
- **Turtle Breakout (Algo 25)** — default for the Donchian range-breakout strategy:
  Turtle version, entry period 20, exit period 10; take-profit off, stop-loss off,
  drawdown limit 5%.
- **Smart Range Breakout (Algo 8)** — Donchian range-breakout strategy, Locked version,
  channel period 20, ATR padding multiplier 0.5; take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 2%,
  drawdown limit 5%.
- **SMA Band Reversion (Algo 5)** — default for the Rolling-Average Reversion strategy:
  SMA average, window 20, band distance, entry threshold 1%, exit threshold 0.5%, revert
  exit; take-profit off, stop-loss 2%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **Z-Score Reversion (Algo 4)** — Rolling-Average Reversion strategy: SMA average,
  window 20, z-score distance, entry z 1.0, exit z 0.2, revert exit; take-profit off,
  stop-loss 2%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **Mean Cross Reversion (Algo 14)** — Rolling-Average Reversion strategy: SMA average,
  window 60, band distance with entry threshold 0 (bare cross), bracket exit;
  take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 1%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **VWAP Cross Reversion (Algo 39)** — Rolling-Average Reversion strategy: volume-weighted
  average, window 60, band distance with entry threshold 0 (bare cross), bracket exit;
  take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 1%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **SuperTrend (Algo 9)** — default for the ATR-Band Trend strategy: SuperTrend version,
  window 20, ATR multiplier 3; take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 0.5%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **Keltner Breakout (Algo 21)** — ATR-Band Trend strategy, Keltner version, window 20, ATR
  multiplier 1, midline exit on; take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 1%, drawdown limit 5% (the course
  script has no drawdown stop; 5% follows the catalog convention).
- **ADX Trend Strength (Algo 12)** — default for the ADX Trend Strength strategy: period 10,
  threshold 20; take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 1%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **VWAP + ADX Reversion (Algo 15)** — Rolling-Average Reversion strategy: typical-price
  average, window 20, band distance with entry threshold 0 (bare cross), bracket exit, ADX danger
  exit on with lookback 20 and threshold 20; take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss off, drawdown limit 5%.
- **MACD Momentum (Algo 10)** — default for the MACD Momentum strategy: fast 12, slow 26, signal
  9; take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 0.5%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **Heikin-Ashi Trend (Algo 11)** — default for the Heikin-Ashi Trend strategy: volume filter off;
  take-profit 0.5%, stop-loss 1%, drawdown limit 5%.
- **Heikin-Ashi + Volume (Algo 37)** — Heikin-Ashi Trend strategy with the volume filter on over a
  20-bar volume average; take-profit off, stop-loss off, drawdown limit 5%.

#### Scenario: List presets
