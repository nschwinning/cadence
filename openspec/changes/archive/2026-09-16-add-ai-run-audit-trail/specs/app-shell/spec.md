## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Persistent application shell

The system SHALL present a persistent shell (header and sidebar navigation with the main content area) around every page. Navigation SHALL offer entries for Dashboard, Assets, Portfolios, Paper Trading, and Runs, and SHALL indicate the active view. The shell SHALL be responsive, collapsing the sidebar on small viewports.

#### Scenario: Navigate between views

- **WHEN** a user selects a navigation entry
- **THEN** the application SHALL render that view within the shell and mark the entry active without a full page reload

#### Scenario: Small viewport

- **WHEN** the viewport is narrow
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL collapse into a toggleable menu

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: AI run history and detail views

The system SHALL provide a Runs view that lists AI runs (build and rebalance) across all sessions, newest first, showing at least each run's type, status, number of orders executed, and time, and SHALL let a user open a run to a detail view. The run detail view SHALL show the run's AI reasoning, its research (each web search's query and results), the trades the run opened, and the positions the run closed.

#### Scenario: Browse runs

- **WHEN** a user opens the Runs view
- **THEN** the UI SHALL list AI runs across all sessions newest first and allow opening any run's detail

#### Scenario: Inspect a run

- **WHEN** a user opens a run's detail
- **THEN** the UI SHALL display the run's reasoning, its research (queries and results), the trades it opened, and the positions it closed
