# ai-paper-trading Specification

## Purpose
Lets an AI assemble a portfolio and execute it as simulated (paper) trades on a brokerage, recording the resulting session, trades, and an auditable trail of AI decisions, so a user can watch an AI-managed strategy run against real market prices without risking capital.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Brokerage abstraction with paper/live and offline modes

The system SHALL access the brokerage through a single abstraction exposing account information, positions, quotes, order submission, order status, and a market-open check. Whether it targets the paper or live brokerage endpoint SHALL be determined by configuration, defaulting to paper. The system SHALL support an offline mode (selectable by configuration) that simulates the brokerage without any network calls, for local development and tests.

#### Scenario: Paper mode by default

- **WHEN** no live mode is configured
- **THEN** the system SHALL direct all brokerage calls to the paper trading endpoint

#### Scenario: Offline mode

- **WHEN** offline brokerage mode is enabled
- **THEN** the system SHALL satisfy account, position, quote, and order operations without external network calls

#### Scenario: Missing credentials

- **WHEN** live/paper mode is active but brokerage credentials are absent
- **THEN** the system SHALL fail the operation with a clear error rather than sending an unauthenticated request

### Requirement: Build an AI portfolio and execute it as paper trades

The system SHALL accept a request to build an AI portfolio over the entire current asset universe and an amount of capital to allocate, with options for risk profile and whether the portfolio is enrolled in daily rebalancing. The request SHALL NOT accept a candidate ticker list or per-position allocation caps. The AI SHALL be given every asset in the universe (enriched with name, sector, category, and eligibility) as candidates, MAY research and propose assets not currently in the universe (discovery is always enabled), and SHALL produce long-only target holdings whose allocations are fractions in [0, 1] that sum to approximately 1.0 (an allocation of ~0 excludes a holding). Newly discovered tickers SHALL be added to the universe on a best-effort basis, bounded by a configured maximum number of new assets per run; if an add fails the ticker SHALL still be eligible for the portfolio. The request SHALL be processed in the background and SHALL return immediately with an event identifier for polling. Execution SHALL: ask the AI for target holdings and allocations, create a portfolio and a paper-trading session, size each position from the allocated capital and a current quote, submit the corresponding buy orders through the brokerage, and record each executed trade and a run summary. The AI's research SHALL be cost-bounded per run by a configured maximum number of reasoning turns and a hard cap on the number of web searches.

#### Scenario: Queue a build

- **WHEN** a client requests an AI portfolio build while the asset universe is non-empty
- **THEN** the system SHALL create a build event, start background processing, and respond with the event id and a running status

#### Scenario: Empty universe rejected

- **WHEN** a client requests an AI portfolio build while the asset universe is empty
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request rather than starting a build

#### Scenario: Build executes

- **WHEN** the background build runs
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the portfolio and session, place the sized buy orders via the brokerage, record the executed trades and a run entry, and mark the build event succeeded (or partial if some orders could not be placed)

#### Scenario: AI discovers a new asset

- **WHEN** the AI proposes a holding whose ticker is not in the current universe
- **THEN** the system SHALL attempt to add that asset to the universe (up to the configured per-run limit) and SHALL still include the ticker in the portfolio and its trades even if the add fails

#### Scenario: Position too small to trade

- **WHEN** an allocation buys less than one whole share at the current quote
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip that position without failing the whole build and SHALL record it as not executed

### Requirement: Poll AI portfolio build status

The system SHALL let a client fetch the status of a build event by its identifier, exposing the run status, the resulting session and portfolio identifiers, the AI's structured output, the actions taken, any error, and a duration.

#### Scenario: Poll a build event

- **WHEN** a client polls a build event id
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the current status and, once finished, the session id, portfolio id, and the actions taken

### Requirement: Record sessions, trades, runs, and closed positions

The system SHALL persist, per paper-trading session, the executed trades (ticker, side, quantity, price, notional, signal type, order identity and status), a run entry per execution (counts and a trigger and status), the session's open positions in a ledger (per held ticker: quantity, weighted-average cost, and opened date), and closed positions with realized profit and loss when positions are exited. Every executed fill SHALL update the open-position ledger (a buy opens or increases an entry and re-computes its weighted-average cost; a sell reduces or removes it), and realized profit and loss SHALL be derived from the ledger entry's average cost and opened date. Each AI build or rebalance SHALL be recorded as an AI-portfolio event capturing the AI's output (its reasoning) and the actions taken, and SHALL also persist the run's research transcript: the web searches performed during the run and, for each, the query and the results the agent received (or a note when a search was not performed, e.g. the per-run search budget was exhausted). Each trade and each closed position produced by an AI build or rebalance SHALL record a reference to the AI-portfolio event that produced it; trades not produced by an AI run SHALL leave this reference empty.

#### Scenario: Trades and run recorded on execution

- **WHEN** a build or rebalance places orders
- **THEN** the system SHALL record a trade per executed order, a run entry summarizing the execution, updated open-position ledger entries, and (for exits) closed positions with realized P&L

#### Scenario: Trades and closed positions reference their run

- **WHEN** an AI build or rebalance records a trade or a closed position
- **THEN** the recorded trade or closed position SHALL reference the AI-portfolio event that produced it

#### Scenario: Research transcript persisted

- **WHEN** an AI build or rebalance reaches the agent and the agent performs web searches
- **THEN** the recorded AI-portfolio event SHALL persist each search's query and the results the agent received

#### Scenario: Research captured despite a mid-run failure

- **WHEN** an AI run fails after the agent has already performed one or more web searches
- **THEN** the recorded (failed) AI-portfolio event SHALL still persist the research captured before the failure

### Requirement: Read paper-trading session data

The system SHALL let a client list paper-trading sessions and read a session's trades, runs, positions, its AI-portfolio events, and its daily portfolio-value snapshots. An AI-portfolio event returned to a client SHALL include the AI's reasoning output and its persisted research transcript. A trade or closed position returned to a client SHALL include the reference to the AI-portfolio event that produced it, when present. A session's value history SHALL be returned ordered oldest snapshot first.

#### Scenario: Inspect a session

- **WHEN** a client requests a session's trades, runs, positions, or events
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the recorded data for that session

#### Scenario: Event includes reasoning and research

- **WHEN** a client reads an AI-portfolio event
- **THEN** the returned event SHALL include the AI reasoning output and the persisted research transcript

#### Scenario: Read session value history

- **WHEN** a client requests a session's value history
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the session's daily value snapshots ordered oldest first, each with its date, total value, cash value, positions value, and day's profit and loss

### Requirement: Trade both equities and crypto assets

The system SHALL determine each asset's class (equity or crypto) from its stored
asset record and route brokerage calls accordingly. For crypto it SHALL translate
symbols between the universe's canonical format (e.g. `BTC-USD`) and the brokerage
format (e.g. `BTC/USD`) at the brokerage boundary, submit orders with a
crypto-compatible time-in-force and fractional quantities, and read quotes from the
brokerage's crypto market-data endpoints. Positions returned by the brokerage SHALL
be reconciled back to canonical universe tickers. Equity routing SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: Crypto order routing

- **WHEN** the executor places an order for an asset classified as crypto
- **THEN** the system SHALL send the brokerage-format crypto symbol with a
  crypto-compatible time-in-force and a fractional quantity, not an equities-style
  whole-share day order

#### Scenario: Crypto quote routing

- **WHEN** the executor requests a quote for a crypto asset
- **THEN** the system SHALL obtain the price from the brokerage's crypto market-data
  endpoint rather than the equities endpoint

#### Scenario: Position reconciliation

- **WHEN** the brokerage reports a crypto position in its own symbol format
- **THEN** the system SHALL map it to the canonical universe ticker so it matches
  the portfolio's holdings during rebalance

### Requirement: Fractional sizing for crypto

The system SHALL size crypto positions as fractional units of the asset, skipping a
position only when its value falls below the brokerage's minimum tradable notional.
Equity positions SHALL continue to be sized in whole shares, skipping allocations
smaller than one share.

#### Scenario: Fractional crypto position

- **WHEN** a crypto allocation buys less than one whole unit at the current price
- **THEN** the system SHALL place a fractional-unit order rather than skipping it

#### Scenario: Below minimum notional

- **WHEN** a crypto allocation's value is below the brokerage minimum notional
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip that position without failing the run and record it
  as not executed

### Requirement: Rebalance crypto around the clock

Because crypto trades 24/7, the daily rebalance SHALL execute crypto trades even
when the equities market is closed. When the equities market is closed, the system
SHALL still rebalance crypto holdings and targets and SHALL skip only the equity
orders. The system SHALL record the run as skipped (no orders) only when nothing is
tradable — that is, the equities market is closed and neither the current positions
nor the targets include any crypto.

#### Scenario: Crypto rebalances while equities market is closed

- **WHEN** a daily rebalance runs while the equities market is closed and the
  session holds or targets crypto
- **THEN** the system SHALL trade the crypto toward its targets and skip equity
  orders, recording the run as executed rather than skipped

#### Scenario: Nothing tradable while closed

- **WHEN** a daily rebalance runs while the equities market is closed and neither
  the positions nor the targets include any crypto
- **THEN** the system SHALL record a skipped run and mark the rebalance event
  skipped

### Requirement: Browse AI run history and details

The system SHALL let a client list AI runs (build and rebalance events) across all sessions, ordered newest first, with pagination and optional filtering by run type and status, and SHALL return a total count for the applied filter. The system SHALL let a client open a single AI run by its identifier and receive that run's detail: the run's reasoning output and research transcript, the trades it opened, and the positions it closed (the trades and closed positions referencing that run). Requesting an unknown run identifier SHALL return a not-found error.

#### Scenario: List runs across sessions

- **WHEN** a client requests the AI run list
- **THEN** the system SHALL return AI runs across all sessions ordered newest first, honoring pagination and any type/status filter, together with the matching total count

#### Scenario: Open a run's detail

- **WHEN** a client requests a run by its identifier
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the run's reasoning, its research transcript, the trades it opened, and the positions it closed

#### Scenario: Unknown run

- **WHEN** a client requests a run identifier that does not exist
- **THEN** the system SHALL return a not-found error

### Requirement: Maintain a per-session open-position ledger

The system SHALL maintain, per paper-trading session, a ledger of its currently open
positions — one entry per held ticker carrying the open quantity, a weighted-average
cost basis, and the date the position was opened. This ledger SHALL be the source of
truth for what a session holds and at what cost. The system SHALL NOT determine a
session's holdings by intersecting account-wide brokerage positions with the
portfolio's ticker list; the brokerage SHALL be used only to submit orders and to
price positions.

Every executed fill SHALL update the ledger: a buy SHALL open a new ledger entry or
increase an existing entry's quantity and re-compute its weighted-average cost from
the filled price; a sell SHALL reduce the entry's quantity and, when the position is
fully exited, remove the entry. A session's holdings SHALL be attributed to that
session alone, so two sessions holding the same ticker SHALL each track their own
quantity and cost basis independently.

Rebalance SHALL compute its share deltas from the ledger's current quantities, and
close SHALL liquidate the positions recorded in the ledger. Realized profit and loss
recorded when a position is exited SHALL use the ledger entry's average cost as the
entry price and its opened date as the entry date.

#### Scenario: Buy opens or increases a ledger entry

- **WHEN** a build or rebalance executes a buy fill for a session
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the session's ledger entry for that ticker, or
  increase its quantity and re-compute its weighted-average cost from the filled price

#### Scenario: Sell reduces or closes a ledger entry

- **WHEN** a rebalance or close executes a sell fill for a session
- **THEN** the system SHALL reduce that ledger entry's quantity and remove the entry
  when the position is fully exited

#### Scenario: Holdings are attributed per session

- **WHEN** two sessions each hold the same ticker
- **THEN** each session's ledger SHALL reflect only its own quantity and cost basis,
  independent of the other session and of the account-wide brokerage position

#### Scenario: Rebalance and close read the ledger

- **WHEN** a rebalance computes deltas or a close liquidates positions
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the session's ledger quantities as the current
  holdings, not the account-wide brokerage positions

#### Scenario: Realized P&L uses ledger basis

- **WHEN** a position is exited
- **THEN** the recorded realized profit and loss SHALL use the ledger entry's average
  cost as the entry price and its opened date as the entry date

### Requirement: Snapshot session portfolio value at end of day

The system SHALL, on a scheduled end-of-day trigger, record one portfolio-value
snapshot per active AI-managed session (a session whose strategy is AI-managed and
whose status is active) and send a daily profit-and-loss report. The trigger SHALL
be a cron-guarded endpoint protected by the shared cron-token secret, and SHALL
reject a request with a missing or invalid token. Recording SHALL be idempotent per
session per day: re-running the trigger on the same calendar day SHALL update that
day's snapshot rather than create a duplicate.

Each snapshot SHALL record the session's total value, its cash value, the market
value of its held positions, the day's profit and loss (absolute and percent), and a
per-position breakdown (per held ticker: quantity, price, market value, unrealized
profit and loss, and return). A session's total value SHALL be computed by marking its
open positions — taken from the session's position ledger — to market and combining
them with the session's allocated capital and realized profit and loss. The day's
profit and loss SHALL be measured against the
session's most recent prior snapshot, or against its allocated capital when no prior
snapshot exists. A session holding no positions SHALL record an all-cash snapshot.

The report SHALL contain, for each session snapshotted, a line with the session's
total value and the day's profit and loss (absolute and percent), plus the single
best-performing and single worst-performing individual holding ranked by return
across all snapshotted sessions. A failure to deliver the report SHALL NOT fail the
snapshot job.

#### Scenario: Daily snapshot recorded for active AI sessions

- **WHEN** the end-of-day snapshot trigger runs with a valid cron token
- **THEN** the system SHALL record a value snapshot for each active AI-managed
  session and SHALL NOT record snapshots for paused, stopped, or non-AI sessions

#### Scenario: Snapshot is idempotent per day

- **WHEN** the snapshot trigger runs twice on the same calendar day for a session
- **THEN** the system SHALL retain a single snapshot for that session and day,
  reflecting the latest run, rather than creating a duplicate

#### Scenario: Daily P&L baseline

- **WHEN** a snapshot is recorded for a session that has a prior snapshot
- **THEN** the day's profit and loss SHALL be the change in total value since the
  prior snapshot; **AND WHEN** the session has no prior snapshot, the day's profit
  and loss SHALL be measured against the session's allocated capital

#### Scenario: Daily report summarizes P&L and extremes

- **WHEN** the snapshot job completes with at least one session snapshotted
- **THEN** the system SHALL send a report with a per-session value and P&L line and
  with the best- and worst-performing individual holding across the snapshotted
  sessions

#### Scenario: Report delivery failure does not fail the job

- **WHEN** report delivery fails
- **THEN** the snapshot job SHALL still complete and the recorded snapshots SHALL
  remain persisted

#### Scenario: Invalid cron token is rejected

- **WHEN** the snapshot trigger is called without a valid cron token
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request and record no snapshots
